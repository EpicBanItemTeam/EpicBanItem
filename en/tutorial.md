# Tutorial

This part is created for newcomers who knows nothing about EpicBanItem in order to help them get started quickly.

## Plugin Installation

Please download the [latest recommended version](https://ore.spongepowered.org/EpicBanItem/EpicBanItem/versions/recommended/download) on the Ore distribution platform, and put the downloaded plugin file into `mods/` folder. There are not any other ways provided officially to download EpicBanItem.

**The server should fit one of two requirements so that EpicBanItem is able to work normally**:

* **Based on SpongeVanilla whose version is no lower than `1.12.2-7.1.0-BETA-98`**.
* **Based on SpongeForge whose version is no lower than `1.12.2-2705-7.1.0-BETA-3361`**.

However, we recommend installing the latest version of either SpongeVanilla or SpongeForge even though EpicBanItem itself should work on any version which is no lower than the versions shown above. The reason is that there may be some BUGs caused by other plugins or Sponge itself, which may interfere with EpicBanItem.
